# Stereograph Core

Stereograph Core aims to provide a collection of various libraries that can be imported into an Angular 2, NodeJS, or ES6 application, and is available through NPM. The vision is to store re-usable code that can be used in various JavaScript projects. More information and libraries will be added over time, as this collection of Core functionality is still in the early stages of development.
